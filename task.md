Design a modern and simple wedding invitation website that mimics the luxurious feel of opening a physical multi-page invitation card. The overall aesthetic should be colorful with a folkloric vibe, featuring a light creamy greenish background, white text for elegance, and subtle incorporations of flowers and fruits as decorative elements throughout. Include the bride and groom's names prominently in various sections.

Structure the website as a single-page scrollable experience divided into multiple "card" sections, where each section transitions smoothly with a nice paper-opening animation effect (like unfolding or flipping a page) when scrolling. Use smooth, subtle animations to enhance the luxurious feel without overwhelming the simplicity.

Key sections in order:

1. **Hero/First Card**: Display the bride and groom's names in large, elegant white or black text, highlighted with the wedding date below them. Incorporate floral and fruit motifs around the text for a vibrant, folkloric touch.

2. **Venue Section/Second Card**: On scroll, reveal the wedding venue details with an embedded Google Maps integration showing the location. Keep text in white, with subtle animations unfolding the map like opening an envelope.

3. **Invitation Message/Third Card**: Include a heartfelt invitation message mentioning the family names, specifically the bride's father and mother. Style it simply and modernly, with white text on the creamy green background, accented by flower and fruit illustrations.

Ensure the design is responsive for mobile and desktop, with high-quality animations using CSS or JavaScript libraries like GSAP for smooth scrolling effects. Keep the layout clean, minimalistic, and luxurious, avoiding clutter.
